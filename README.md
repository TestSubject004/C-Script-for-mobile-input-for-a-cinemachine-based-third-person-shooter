# C-Script-for-mobile-input-for-a-cinemachine-based-third-person-shooter

The script provides a very basic template for a touch input solution in a cinemachine-based camera system for mobile. This script was designed to overcome the problem of
touch-input passing through the GUI elements.

You need to have your own UI system and control scheme before you can use this script.

This script focuses solely on mouse/lookaround movements although the script can be repurposed for other similar input styles.
